I am an AI/ML engineer with **10+ years of practical experience**, currently working as a
**Senior AI/ML engineer at MSD Czech Republic**. Previously, I have been part of large companies
such as **Amazon and Seznam.cz**, as well as local startups. I also have experience collaborating
with universities in Czech Republic and Spain. I have always enjoyed and found fulfillment in
**knowledge sharing**, and I have been **teaching Python to beginners for 5+
years**. I have also created several lectures and workshops with the goal of passing on my knowledge
to others. I believe in a friendly and individual approach that helps students achieve their goals faster and
more efficiently.
